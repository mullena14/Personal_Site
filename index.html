        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Alicia Mullen and I am
            an emerging engineer and visual artist. The reason I developed this
            site was to showcase my range of skills and provide concrete examples
            of my work to potential employers. Feel free to contact me with
            questions or comments, and please enjoy browsing this site.

        <h2>Current Position</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently employed as a Systems Engineer at Philips Oral Health
            Care. My primary responsibilities are to design requirements for our
            products and test our designs to verify they meet these requirments.
            My group is a part of the Research and Development process, and we
            get the exciting opportunity to perfect our products and confirm they
            meet our quality standards before they enter the market.

            To see a full list of the jobs I've held, please check my resume.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University
          of Washington, but long before I entered the engineering world I was
          fortunate enough to receive seven years of visual arts and design
          training in the heart of Portland, OR. I truly thrive in the junction
          between art and engineering and would love an opportunity where I
          could use a larger range of my skill set in the work environment.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Please check out my portfolios in the links provided. I have organized
          my projects into five catagories: engineering, visual arts,
          digital design, start-ups, and miscellaneous projects. You will see
          that I enjoy taking on a large variety of projects and I am always
          looking for new challenges.
