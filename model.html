        <h1>Designer's personal statement</h1>
        <p>
            The following projects were designed in open source software, as I am
            a self-taught 3D & 2D modeler. My initial interest in digital modeling was
            sparked by my areas of professional study (art and engineering) and
            has developed to an intermediate level of proficency. I can
            comfortably design in several environments for projects involving 3D
            printing, animation, game design, and architecture.
        </p>

      <h1>3D Digital Design</h1>
      <section>
        <div>
          <h2> Autodesk Fusion 360 </h2>
          <p>
            This was the first 3D modeling suite I learned to use and it has
            since helped me design many techinical prints to support my
            engineering projects.

        <div>
          <h2> Blender </h2>
          <p>
            I first downloaded Blender in middle school when I learned about
            open source development suites, and quickly found it to be unruly.
            Since then I've gained more patience with myself and the learning
            process, and I'm happy to say I'm finally creating my own models!
            Next up, animations?

        <div>
          <h2> SketchUp </h2>
          <p>
            Sketchup is a free web-based design suite for contractors and
            architects. It's simple interface made it easy to learn, and has
            been great for modeling large technical structures such as buildings.

          <h2> Unreal Engine 4 </h2>
          <p>
            To be updated soon!

        <div>
          <h2> Krita </h2>
          <p>
            Another great open source software, Krita! I'm still becoming
            familiar with translating my knowlege of 2D design to this virtual
            format, but it's been fun to play with.
