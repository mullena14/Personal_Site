        <h1>Engineer's personal statement</h1>
        <p>
          Many people ask me how I fell into the engineering world as a devoted
          designer and artist. Well, believe it or not, all it took was
          encouragement. During my brief time in community college I found mentors
          who pushed me to pursue my interest in mathematics. From there,
          engineering seemed like the perfect mix of math and design. So here I am,
          artist and engineer, a foot in both worlds.

        <h1>Embedded Systems (ES)</h1>
        <p>
          Embedded software is my primary field of study, and for which I
          received my B.S. in Engineering from the University of Washington. The
          majority of my experience comes from working with ARM processors,
          Arduinos, and RaspberryPis.

          <h2> Eye Tracker </h2>
          <img src="imgs/engineering/eye_tracker.jpg" alt="prototype eye tracker."/>
          <p>
            This project was completed with a partner in the span of two weeks.
            Our goal was to filter the signal coming from two electrodes placed
            around the eyes and calculate their difference to determine eye
            position. Sadly, our butterworth analog filter failed to cancel out
            excess noise and we ended up creating a heart rate monitor. For the
            end product, the voltage from one electrode was filtered, sampled by
             our ADC, transfered to our UART via microDMA, and received via BLE
             on our custom Android app that graphed the signal over time.

          <h2> Pointilism Printer </h2>
          <img src="imgs/engineering/capstone.jpg" alt="senior year capstone project."/>
          <p>
            This printing robot was designed by myself and a small team as our
            senior year capstone project. It would receive an image from our UI
            via wifi, pixelate the image so that it could be drawn with dots,
            and the naviagated on-top a drawing surface to plot out the image.
            My primary responsibility on this project was drafting our
            requirements, 3D printing and assembling custom parts,
            debugging/testing the full system, and supporting all software
            development (from UI to FW).

          <img src="imgs/engineering/stop_light.jpg" alt="mini stop light using tiva board."/>
          <p>
            One of my first projects on a TM4C Tiva Board. I used the IAR
            Embedded Workbench to develop and test my code. This project used
            FreeRTOS to control a stoplight with crosswalk buttons.

        <h1>Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)</h1>
        <p>
          With ES as my primary field of study, FPGAs come in as a close second.
          Not only did I teach introductory and intermediate digital logic for a
          full year, I've also developed multiple pipelined CPUs (one with
          gates and hierarcy, the other with RTL). I thoroughly enjoy working
          with FPGAs and would love the chance to use them in my professional
          life.

        <h1>High Level Software</h1>
        <p>
          Languages used for script writing and object oriented back-end
          developement:
          <ul>
            <li>Python (advanced)</li>
            <li>C/C++ (advanced)</li>
            <li>MATLAB (advanced)</li>
            <li>Java (intermediate)</li>
            <li>Unix bash (intermediate)<li>
          </ul>
          My first programming language was C/C++, and it remains my most
          familiar coding language. However, I have also worked professionally
          with python, matlab, and bash for script creation, including error analysis,
          unit testing, and process automation. I've also completed several
          programming courses in Java for data structures and algorithms.

        <h1>Front-end Developement</h1>
        <p>
          Languages used for front-end developement (all intermediate):
          <ul>
            <li>HTML5</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
          </ul>
          You are currently observing my front-end development skills as I teach
          myself how to build this website from scratch :)

      <div>
        <h1>Systems</h1>
        <p>
          Most of my professional career I have held the title of Systems
          Engineer. I started as a NASA intern testing flight software, then
          completed a second internship doing error analysis with Ball
          Aerospace, and finally I transitioned to full-time Systems Engineer
          with Philips Oral Health Care. I chose to start my career in Systems
          Engineering because I like big picture ideas and tend to think of
          myself as a multi-disaplinary designer.
